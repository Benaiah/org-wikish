#+TITLE: org-wikish

~org-wikish~ is a simple wiki system for org. It uses a flat directory
structure in a single directory.

* Getting started

After installing the package (it should be available shortly on [[https://melpa.org][MELPA]]
soon), you'll need to set the directory you want your wiki pages to be
stored in. ~org-wikish~ currently only has support for storing wiki
pages in a single directory without nesting.

A simple setup might look like the following:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; set wiki directory
  (setq org-wikish-wiki-directory "/your/wiki/directory/here")

  ;; bind C-c w f to org-wikish-find-page
  (org-wikish-recommended-global-keybindings)

  ;; Enable org-wikish-mode in org-mode
  (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'org-wikish-mode)
#+end_src
